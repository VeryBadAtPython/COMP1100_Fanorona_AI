-- | A very simple AI, which passes whenever it can, and if not,
-- picks the first move returned by the 'legalMoves' function.
-- By default, this function is called on COMP1100 rules, and so
-- will never pass.
-- AIs can rely on the 'legalMoves' list being
-- non-empty; if there were no legal moves, the framework would have
-- ended the game.
